# Synthetic-Data-For-Finance
This repository complements the CFA Institute's Research and Policy Center [Synthetic Data in Investment Management](some_url) report. It aims to serve as a centralized hub for generative AI (genAI) approaches to synthetic data generation and their applications within finance. The repository provides a curated list of libraries,  papers and case studies that can be used for synthetic data generation to aid practitioners and is regularly updated.

## üß† Overview

Synthetic data is artificially generated data designed to resemble real data. It can be used to address data-related challenges such as:
- Lack of historical data 
- Privacy and compliance concerns around data-sharing
- Overfitting in backtesting and model training
- Imbalanced datasets
- Lack of scenario diversity for stress testing

This repository focuses on genAI approaches to synthetic data generation, focusing on the following techniques:
- Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Diffusion models
- Large Language Models (LLMs)

These methods are more flexible than traditional statistical methodologies, allowing for each data type to be modelled - from textual datasets to time-series and tabular data, all common to financial professionals. As a result, synthetic data has a wide range of use cases from risk modelling to forecasting, sentiment analysis and stress-testing.
